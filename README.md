## Overview of the project


### Project : Develop a Python program to track and manage student grades. The program should allow the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or GPA).
### Description:
This Python project aims to create a student grade tracking and management system. Here's a detailed description:

1. **User Interface**: The program should provide a user-friendly interface, possibly through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). This interface will allow users to input grades for various subjects or assignments.

2. **Input Grades**: Users can input grades for different subjects or assignments. They might be prompted to enter grades for specific subjects like Math, Science, English, etc., or for particular assignments within those subjects.

3. **Calculate Average Grade**: The program will calculate the average grade based on the grades inputted by the user. This involves summing up all the grades and dividing by the total number of grades entered.

4. **Display Overall Grade**: After calculating the average grade, the program will display the overall grade. This might be displayed as a numerical value, such as 85%, or as a letter grade, such as "A," "B," "C," etc. 

5. **Additional Information**: The program may also provide additional information, such as a GPA (Grade Point Average) calculation. This could involve mapping letter grades to GPA values according to a predefined scale (e.g., A = 4.0, B = 3.0, etc.) and then calculating the GPA based on the average grade obtained.

6. **Data Persistence**: Optionally, the program might include functionality to store and retrieve student grades from a file or database, allowing users to track progress over time and access historical data.

7. **Error Handling**: It should incorporate robust error handling to ensure that users input valid grades and that the program doesn't crash due to unexpected inputs or actions.

8. **Modularity and Extensibility**: The program should be designed in a modular and extensible way, allowing for easy addition of new features or modifications in the future. This could involve breaking the program into separate functions or classes, each responsible for a specific aspect of the functionality.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for tracking and managing student grades, offering users a convenient way to monitor their academic progress and performance.
